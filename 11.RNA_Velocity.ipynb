#### Introduction   
Similar to pseudotime analysis, RNA velocity aims to reconstruct cell trajectories. However, RNA velocity provides an additional layer of information by predicting the direction of gene expression changes within individual cells over time, enabling the inference of future cellular states. This is achieved by analyzing the ratio of spliced (mature, an indicator of completed transcription) and unspliced (precursor, an indicator of ongoing transcription) RNA. Using these ratios, RNA velocity estimates the rate at which mRNA is being processed in cells, offering insights into transcriptional dynamics.  
Integrating RNA velocity with pseudotime analysis can further enhance the reconstruction of developmental trajectories, providing a comprehensive view of cellular processes. Among the available tools for RNA velocity analysis, Velocyto and scVelo are widely used. Notably, scVelo employs a dynamical model to reconstruct full transcriptional dynamics, offering a more detailed understanding of cellular states and transitions.  
This document introduces a basic pipeline for RNA velocity analysis using "scVelo". Since the reference paper did not provide an accessible input loom file and considering the limitations of running computationally intensive tasks on a local machine, I used the built-in pancreas dataset provided by the Velocyto package as an example.  
For researchers starting from raw FASTQ files generated by 10X Genomics Visium, the steps to generate the required loom file are as follows:    
Use cellranger with a reference genome to produce a BAM file from the raw FASTQ files (command-line, Linux).    
Run Velocyto in Python on the BAM file to generate the loom file.    


#### Step 1: Set the clean environment and Load the required libraries ####

```{python step1, eval=FALSE}

# Notice that: set the unique version environment for each pipeline, and for "scVelo", some special verison used are as follows:
# python  = 3.10.16
# numpy = 1.26.4
# matplotlib-base = 3.10.0
    
import os
import scvelo as scv
import scanpy as sc
import pandas as pd

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib as mpl



SEED = 42
import random
random.seed(SEED)

import numpy as np
np.random.seed(SEED)


print(scv.__version__)
# Change Scanpy's default background color to white
sc.set_figure_params(facecolor="white")
plt.rcParams['figure.facecolor'] = 'white'
plt.rcParams['axes.facecolor'] = 'white'
scv.set_figure_params('scvelo', facecolor='white')


scv.settings.verbosity = 3
# show errors(0), warnings(1), info(2), hints(3)

# set max width size for presenter view
scv.settings.presenter_view = True

# for visualization
scv.set_figure_params('scvelo')


# Set the direction and get the loom data by scanpy
os.chdir('C:/Users/xqbus/Desktop/sg_rnaseq') # Your own directory
output_dir = 'C:/Users/xqbus/Desktop/sg_rnaseq/results'
adata = sc.read("./rdata/bc.loom", cache=False) # Your own loom data
# adata = scv.datasets.pancreas() # the built-in pancreas dataset provided by the Velocyto package


```

#### Step 2: Preprocess the Data and Estimate RNA velocity
```{python step2, eval=FALSE}

# Show the proportions of spliced/unspliced counts
scv.pl.proportions(adata)

# save the figure
output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, "scvelo_initial_proportion.png")
scv.pl.proportions(adata, figsize=(10, 8), dpi=300, show=False)
plt.savefig(output_path, bbox_inches='tight')
plt.close()


```
Here, the proportions of spliced/unspliced counts are displayed. 

<img src="images/scvelo_initial_proportion.png" width="400px" /> 

```{python step3, eval=FALSE}
# Filter the genes with a minimum number of counts=30, and select the top 2000 genes with high variability (dispersion)
scv.pp.filter_and_normalize(adata, min_shared_counts=30, n_top_genes=2000)
sc.tl.pca(adata)

# The moments process is similar to scale in seurat, and computing the first and second order moments among neighbors in PCA space.
scv.pp.moments(adata, n_pcs=30, n_neighbors=30)

# One can run the dynamical model to replace the basic steadt model to learn the full transcriptional dynamics of splicing kinetics.
#scv.tl.recover_dynamics(adata)
# The dynamic  model can take a while to run. Hence, you may want to store the results for re-use
# adata.write('./rdata/pancreas.h5ad', compression='gzip')
# adata = scv.read('./rdata/pancreas.h5ad')

# computing velocities. Positive velocity indicates that a gene is up-regulated, which occurs for cells that show higher abundance of unspliced mRNA for that gene than expected in steady state. Conversely, negative velocity indicates that a gene is down-regulated.
scv.tl.velocity(adata)
scv.tl.velocity_graph(adata) 

# Compute the neighborhood graph
scv.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=10, n_pcs=40, random_state=SEED)

# Define the resolutions to test
resolutions = [0.3, 0.5, 1.0]
# Loop through the resolutions and compute Leiden clustering for each
for res in resolutions:
    key_name = f'leiden_{res}'  # Save each resolution  under a different key
    sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=res, key_added=key_name, random_state=SEED)

# Compute UMAP
sc.tl.umap(adata)
# Visualize the UMAP with clustering results for all resolutions, and select a proper resolution
sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[f'leiden_{res}' for res in resolutions])

# save the figure
output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, "leiden_first_cluster.png")
# Set Scanpy figure parameters
sc.settings.set_figure_params(dpi=300, figsize=(10, 6))
sc.pl.umap(adata, color='leiden_0.5', show = False)
plt.savefig(output_path, bbox_inches='tight')
plt.close()


```
The following UMAP plot visualizes the relationships between cells. The cells are color-coded by Leiden clustering with resolution 0.5, which assigns cells to distinct groups (clusters) based on their transcriptional similarity.

Actually, researchers should use the consistent clusters from their own data generated in the previous steps in Seurat to ensure the integrity and consistency of the data illustration. To achieve this, they need to add the cluster information from the Seurat metadata into the AnnData object by following these steps:

```{python step4, eval=FALSE}

# # Export the cluster information from the Seurat object in R:
# write.csv(SeuratObject@meta.data[, "seurat_clusters"], "seurat_clusters.csv")
# 
# # Import the exported cluster information into Python and integrate it into the AnnData object:
# clusters = pd.read_csv("seurat_clusters.csv", index_col=0)
# adata.obs["seurat_clusters"] = clusters.loc[adata.obs_names, "seurat_clusters"]
# 
# # Visualize the UMAP with clustering results from seurat
# sc.pl.umap(adata, color="seurat_clusters")

```
By doing this, we can ensure that the clustering results from Seurat are preserved and can be used for downstream analyses in AnnData.

#### Step 3: Visulization of  RNA velocity results 

#####  Step 3.1: Project the velocities
```{python step5, eval=FALSE}
# Project the velocities
scv.pl.velocity_embedding_stream(adata, basis='umap', color=['leiden_0.5'])
scv.pl.velocity_embedding(adata, arrow_length=3, arrow_size=2, dpi=300,color=['leiden_0.5'])
scv.pl.velocity_embedding_stream(adata, basis='umap', color=['initial_size_spliced'])

# save the figure
output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, "scvelo_streamline1.png")
scv.pl.velocity_embedding_stream(adata, basis='umap', color=['leiden_0.5'],
                                 figsize=(10, 8), dpi=300, show=False)
plt.savefig(output_path, bbox_inches='tight')
plt.close()



```
<img src="images/scvelo_streamline1.png" width="600px" /> 

This figure visualizes RNA velocity in the context of a UMAP embedding, illustrating both the cluster assignments (via Leiden clustering) and the inferred dynamics of cellular transitions based on the ratio of spliced and unspliced mRNA.  
The color of each dot corresponds to a Leiden cluster, where each cluster represents a distinct transcriptional group of cells. The streamlines represent the inferred RNA velocity, showing the direction and dynamics of transcriptional changes. The arrows indicate the predicted "future" state of cells, illustrating how cells within a cluster may transition to other clusters or remain in their current state.  
For example, clusters with significant overlap in streamlines (e.g., clusters 1 and 5) may represent closely related cell states or functional groups. Cells may transition from a progenitor state (e.g., cluster 1) toward a differentiated state (e.g., cluster 5). However, this example dataset does not have biological significanceâ€”it serves only as a demonstration of RNA velocity analysis.  
For real data, it is critical to assign biological interpretations to clusters based on known developmental or functional relationships. For instance, one could assign transitions between monocytes and macrophages, or between different subclasses of the same cell type, to reflect true biological associations.  


#####  Step 3.2: Interprete the velocities by checking one or several focused genes
```{python step6, eval=FALSE}

# Define the gene name as a variable
GENE = 'COL3A1'
# Generate the velocity plot for the specified gene
scv.pl.velocity(adata, [GENE], dpi=300, color=['leiden_0.5'])

# Save the figure
output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, f"scvelo_{GENE}_portrait.png")
scv.pl.velocity(adata, [GENE], color=['leiden_0.5'], figsize=(10, 7), dpi=300, show=False)
plt.savefig(output_path, bbox_inches='tight')
plt.close()

scv.pl.scatter(adata, 'COL3A1', color=['leiden_0.5', 'velocity'],add_outline=[ 1,5,7,9])


```

<img src="images/scvelo_COL3A1_portrait.png" width="800px" />

This figure provides a detailed analysis of the gene COL3A1 in the context of RNA velocity, showcasing its phase portrait, velocity dynamics, and expression levels across cells.  
Phase Portrait (Left Panel):  
The x-axis represents the spliced mRNA levels (mature transcripts).
The y-axis represents the unspliced mRNA levels (precursor transcripts).
Each dot corresponds to a single cell, colored by cluster (leiden_0.5).    
The black dashed line represents the inferred transcriptional dynamics of COL3A1:
Cells above the line (e.g., red points): Higher levels of unspliced mRNA suggest active transcription of COL3A1.
Cells below the line: Lower levels of unspliced mRNA indicate reduced transcriptional activity or repression.  
Velocity (Middle Panel):  
Displays the RNA velocity of COL3A1 in the UMAP embedding. 
The color gradient represents the upregulation (green) or downregulation (red) of COL3A1 expression.  
Expression (Right Panel):   
Displays the actual spliced mRNA expression levels of COL3A1 across clusters. The color gradient indicates expression levels.
Comparing this with the velocity panel provides insights into how COL3A1 expression is regulated dynamically across the dataset.

This results provide: in which clusters transcriptional activity is high for COL3A1 in certain clusters,  in which clusters cells are transitioning to a state with higher COL3A1 expression, and which clusters currently express COL3A1 at high levels. 

#####  Step 3.3: Identify important genes that have cluster-specific differential velocity expression, being siginificantly higher/lower compared to the remaining population.
```{python step7, eval=FALSE}

scv.tl.rank_velocity_genes(adata, groupby='leiden_0.5', min_corr=0.3)


df = pd.DataFrame(adata.uns['rank_velocity_genes']['names'])
# df = scv.core.get_df(adata.uns['rank_velocity_genes']['names'])

kwargs = dict(frameon=False, size=10, linewidth=1.5)
adata_cluster_1_5 = adata[adata.obs['leiden_0.5'].isin(['1', '5'])]
scv.pl.scatter(adata_cluster_1_5, df['1'][:5], ylabel='cluster 1', **kwargs, color='leiden_0.5')

# Save the figure
output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, "rank_5genes_cluster1.png")
scv.pl.scatter(adata_cluster_1_5, df['1'][:5], ylabel='cluster 1', **kwargs, color='leiden_0.5',
               figsize=(15, 7), dpi=300, show=False)
plt.savefig(output_path, bbox_inches='tight')
plt.close()

```

<img src="images/rank_5genes_cluster1.png" width="800px" />

Each panel shows the dynamics of a top velocity gene for cluster 1: TNC, MATN2,ELN, COL1A2, and INSR, showing its transcriptional dynamics across cells in the dataset. Cells are colored based on their Leiden cluster (leiden_0.5), showing which clusters exhibit specific gene expression dynamics.    
The cells in orange (cluster 1) are above the steady-state line, suggesting active transcription of gene in this cluster.These dynamics also suggest potential transitions between states (e.g., from cluster 1 to cluster 5) involving these genes.  

#####  Step 3.4: Check the coherence, Velocity graph and  pseudotime 
```{python step8, eval=FALSE}

# Speed and coherence, almost not used in published paper
scv.tl.velocity_confidence(adata)
keys = ['velocity_length', 'velocity_confidence']
scv.pl.scatter(adata, c=keys, cmap='coolwarm', perc=[5, 95])
df = adata.obs.groupby('leiden_0.5')[keys].mean().T
df.style.background_gradient(cmap='coolwarm', axis=1)

# Save the figure
output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, "velocity_length_confidence.png")
scv.pl.scatter(adata, c=keys, cmap='coolwarm', perc=[5, 95],
               figsize=(12, 7), dpi=300, show=False)
plt.savefig(output_path, bbox_inches='tight')
plt.close()

# Velocity graph and pseudotime: customs shown, similar to monocle3, almost not used in paper
scv.pl.velocity_graph(adata, threshold=.1,color=['leiden_0.5'])
scv.tl.velocity_pseudotime(adata)
scv.pl.scatter(adata, color='velocity_pseudotime', cmap='gnuplot')

```

<img src="images/velocity_length_confidence.png" width="600px" />

These plots help in identifying regions or clusters of cells with high transcriptional activity and reliable velocity measurements.    
Left Plot: "Velocity Length" represents the magnitude of RNA velocity vectors for individual cells, visualized using the velocity_length metric.Cells with higher velocity lengths are transitioning more rapidly in gene expression space.  
Right Plot: "Velocity Confidence", shows the confidence in the RNA velocity calculation for each cell, based on the velocity_confidence metric. Cells in red regions are those where the RNA velocity prediction is deemed more reliable.  

#####  Step 3.5: PAGA velocity graph 
This part provides a graph-like map of the data topology with weighted edges corresponding to the connectivity between two clusters.
```{python step9, eval=FALSE}

adata.uns['neighbors']['distances'] = adata.obsp['distances']
adata.uns['neighbors']['connectivities'] = adata.obsp['connectivities']

#ValueError: mismatching number of index arrays for shape; got 0, expected 2
# conda install scipy=1.11.4 to downdegrade the version from 1.14.1 to 1.11.4, helps to solve the above error
scv.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden_0.5')
scv.pl.paga(adata, basis='umap', size=50, alpha=0.1, min_edge_width=2, node_size_scale=1.5)


# Save the figure
output_path = os.path.join(output_dir, "velocity_paga.png")
scv.pl.paga(adata, basis='umap', size=50, alpha=0.1, min_edge_width=2, node_size_scale=1.5,
               figsize=(12, 10), dpi=300, show=False)
plt.savefig(output_path, bbox_inches='tight')
plt.close()


```

<img src="images/velocity_paga.png" width="600px" />

Each node represents a cluster of cells, with different colors corresponding to distinct clusters. The size of the nodes reflects the number of cells in each cluster. Larger nodes correspond to clusters with more cells.  
The edges (directed arrows) between clusters indicate inferred transcriptional transitions based on RNA velocity. The direction of the arrows shows the predicted progression or flow of gene expression dynamics between clusters, helping to identify potential lineage relationships.
Thicker and darker edges represent stronger connectivity or transitions between clusters, suggesting a more robust flow of cells from one cluster to another.   
For example, a strong arrow from cluster 1 to cluster 5 suggests that cells in cluster 6 are likely transitioning toward the transcriptional state represented by cluster 4. Nodes with multiple outgoing arrows (e.g., cluster 1) may act as branching points in the trajectory, representing intermediate or multipotent states.  
This result helps identify clusters that might correspond to initial states, intermediate states, or terminal differentiation states, based on their connectivity and arrow directions.
