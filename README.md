# Single-cell RNA-seq and Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis Pipeline

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this study is to gain hands-on experience with the scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics workflow. This includes data preprocessing, normalization, clustering, and downstream analysis using R/Python, utilizing up-to-date packages related to this field.

## Data Source
The datasets were sourced from a research study by Zhu et al. (2022), titled "Delineating the dynamic evolution from preneoplasia to invasive lung adenocarcinoma by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics." [DOI: 10.1038/s12276-022-00896-9](https://doi.org/10.1038/s12276-022-00896-9). Data were collected from nine primary LUAD samples from three distinct stages: adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), and invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC).

### Datasets Details:
1. **ScRNA-seq using NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) platforms:**
   - Total of 115,246 cells, including:
     - 37,143 cells (32.2%) from AIS,
     - 30,909 cells (26.8%) from MIA,
     - 47,194 cells (41.0%) from IAC.
2. **Spatial RNA-seq using 10x Genomics Visium platforms:**
   - Six specimens (AIS: TD5, TD8; MIA: TD3, TD6; IAC: TD1, TD2) analyzed by scRNA-seq were further subjected to ST.
